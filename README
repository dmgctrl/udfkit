INTRODUCTION

Hello and thanks for checking out UDFKit.

UDFKit was originally part of RipIt, the simplest DVD ripper available for the 
Macintosh, and is now available to the public.

DVD discs are formatted as UDF filesystems.  UDFKit was designed to make it
easy to read files directly from a disc (or disc image.)

As part of RipIt, UDFKit has been extensively tested against more than 10,000
different discs, with compatibility in excess of 99.6%.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

On Macintosh systems, UDFKit has been extensively tested on Mac OS X version 
10.5 and greater, though there should be no major obstacles to compiling and
running UDFKit on older versions of Mac OS X.
